This project demonstate how Domain Name System (DNS) logs can be analyzed using Splunk SIEM to detect unsual pattern of network behavior or securiry theat.
By examing DNS query and respons patterns, it is possible to identify anomalies that may indicate misconfiguration or malicious activity within a network.

This project was completed as part of my cybersecurity learning practice SIEM Log Analysis using sample log data.

# Objectives
1. Understand how DNS log data works and what information it contains.
2. Upload and parse DNS log in Splunk SIEM.
3. Extract important fields such source IP, destination IP, and domain names
4. Build search queries to identify abnormal patterns or suspicious domains and visulize result and sumarize finding.
